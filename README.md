# Improper Error Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Dart code: insufficient error handling in an asynchronous operation.  The provided `bug.dart` file contains code that fetches data from a remote API.  While it includes a `try-catch` block, error handling is incomplete.  The solution file, `bugSolution.dart`, shows improved error handling, providing more context and options for recovery.

## Bug Description

The `bug.dart` code only prints the error to the console. This approach is inadequate for production applications.  A robust application needs to handle errors gracefully, perhaps displaying a user-friendly message, retrying the request, or implementing alternative logic.
